        "# Assignment 2: Evaluating and Extending an RNN based Part-of-Speech Tagger\n",
        "\n",
        "*version 2024.1, bugs might be patched after publication, you will be notified if this happens*\n",
        "\n",
        "When solving a new problem (or an old problem on a new data set), there are often some \"shoulders of giants\" to stand on. Your first step is often to look for recent and/or well cited papers, and try to download someone's code for solving a similar problem to the one you are faced with. The challenge is as much about understanding and adapting already existing code as it is about theoretical knowledge and scientific creativity.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this assignment, you start with a working pipeline for PoS tagging using LSTMs and mini-batch training. Your task is to evaluate the model on a number of sources in different languages, and extend it with new functionality. First, the neural model represents your tokens as non-pretrained embedding vectors. Then the sequences of embedding vectors are passed through an LSTM layer. Finally, the outputs from the recurrent layer are transformed to probabilities over PoS tags by passing them through a fully connected layer and a softmax. You will have to refactor (i.e. rearrange the code) and extend the model by adding some commonly used properties, e.g. bi-directionality (see the list of suggestions below).\n",
        "\n",
        "The familiar Brown corpus is used for the reference implementation. This corpus should not be used in your submission.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Submission\n",
        "\n",
        "Please submit your code as a notebook through studium. Your submission must satisfy the following requirements:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A working implementation of your pipeline, reproducing your principal results when run (including downloading any data). Please ensure that outputs are stored in the notebook (preferably by rerunning your notebook as the last thing you do before submitting).\n",
        "2. Comment the code properly, especially for longer or opaque functionality. Please try to write self documenting code (e.g. choosing descriptive variables names, refactor to isolate functionality and minimize code duplication). This will also help you debug your code.\n",
        "4. Comments on what you thought was hard in the assignment, what you think was educational, what took most time, and which parts might be unnecessarily tricky.\n",
        "5. As the submission is anonymous, **all personal information must be removed**.\n",
        "6. Apart from sections and titles, please remove all unnecessary text and code from the notebook you hand in (e.g., this instuction). Keep only that which strengthens the case that you fulfil the goals for the grade that you want.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements for grade G\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve a pass (G) on this assignment, you must solve the following tasks without serious errors:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Extend the given model in at least three of the ways listed in the *extensions* section. State clearly which ones you have implemented.\n",
        "2. Include a short (250-500 words) qualitative analysis in your submission. Discuss the performance difference between languages/genres and design choices. You can spread this in the notebook or put them in one place.\n",
        "3. Refactor the given model as a class (including relevant preprocessing, forward/backward pass etc). Your model class should follow the sklearn API where possible.\n",
        "4. Not all languages require the same model complexity for PoS tagging. Some might need a higher dimensionality for the embedding or layers for the model to perform well. Briefly explore the relation between model complexity and accuracy. (Note that the goal is to examine model properties, not to get state-of-the-art accuracy)\n",
        "5. In your quantitative evaluation, use some genre of text in three languages from the [universal dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) project (UD). These will be in the familiar `.conllu` format. Parse the files to get the words (not lemmas).\n",
        "6. Network accuracy for one model doesn't say much about how well a model performs. For some problems, 90% accuracy is easy to achieve, while for other problems 40% is state of the art. Establish a baseline accuracy (in code) and compare your results to it.\n",
        "7. The training and testing data must be kept separate. This means that you could be forced to process unknown tokens from the test data. You should find some way of handling these out-of-vocabulary words (OOV).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional requirements for grade VG\n",
        "\n",
        "For a pass with distinction grade (VG), you should extend your analysis to include all the items under *extensions*. In addition, prepare (and hand in) a short presentation in pdf format (2-4 slides, 200-500 word synopsis) presenting some of your results, design choices, and data sources. You can make your life easier by choosing a language that you speak, test different pipeline alternatives and genres, and, finally, show your results and interpret them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Extensions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. There are other types of RNNs layers commonly used in NLP. Add the option to use a GRU layer instead of an LSTM layer, and include this in your performance comparison.\n",
        "2. The given implementation only allows for dependencies from left to right. Add the option to use a bi-directional RNN layer.\n",
        "3. Use pyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes for loading the data. [This tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html) is a good starting point. Proper data loaders makes it easier to loop over data sets.\n",
        "4. Try some type of data augmentation in your training data (e.g. masking random tokens). This should theoretically increase the generalizability of your model. How much augmentation is too much?\n",
        "5. Implement some level of regularization in your model. This can be implemented in several ways, e.g. dropout or weight decay. Briefly argue for the choices you made and show how network preformance might change with the rate of regularization.\n",
        "6. Add more sources. Either from different genres and/or adding more languages. A suggestion is to try how languages with very different levels of morphological richness (e.g. English vs Finnish) requires more or less training data, or how well a model trained on academic english does on news text. The total number of sources should be above 10.\n",
        "7. Compare performace using UD's universal vs language specific tag sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Note that fully evaluating all combinations of the extensions is not required. It is enough to do some structured testing of extensions and then, for example, go on to compare the tag sets on the best model configuration. This is an exercise in extending and evaluating a model, not in finding the patience to wait for your computer to finish grid searching over alternatives.*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## General advice\n",
        "\n",
        "Work from the given code and change one piece at a time, ensuring functionality throughout your work. You should test your code every couple of lines to make sure your assumptions on functionality and variable content are correct. A good rule of thumb is that a coder will introduce a bug every five lines (even as a professional).\n",
        "\n",
        "To make sure your code does what it's supposed to do, use ```assert``` statements to check your assumptions. Keep the given asserts if you need them. Professional coders sometimes start with writing tests for some functionality instead of starting with the functionality itself. This is called *test-driven development*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a platform with a GPU will be very helpful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, remember the great motto **RTFM**. It will save you in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Plagiarism\n",
        "\n",
        "In code assignments, plagiarism is a tricky concept. A clean cut way would be to demand that you write all the code yourself, from memory, with only the assigned literature as help. This is not how code is developed professionally though. It is common to copy and share. However, since this is a learning exercise, you must implement everything on your own, but please look at the course repo, Stack Overflow etc. Moreover, discuss with course mates and TAs to find inspiration and solutions. Code that is *obviously* copied (with minor modifications) will be considered as plagiarized. As a part of the examination, you might be asked to explain any particular part of the functionality in your implementation."
