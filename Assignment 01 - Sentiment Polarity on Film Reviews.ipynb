        "# Assignment 1: Sentiment Polarity for Film Reviews\n",
        "\n",
        "*version 2024.2, details/bugs in this assignment might be patched, you will be notified if this happens*\n",
        "\n",
        "For this assignment, you will implement a classification pipeline for a binary sentiment classification task. The provided dataset includes film reviews, labelled as either positive or negative. Your starting point for the assignment is an implementation of the full pipeline that uses scikit learn and example data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In most real-world situations, you will have good (and relatively bug free) tools at your disposal. However, for being able to be creative with an ML problem, it is crucial to understand the inner workings of a full pipeline. You will therefore re-implement the model, feature extraction, the learning algorithm, the prediction algorithm, and a simple grid search for hyperparameters. You will find re-implementation tasks marked \"implementation task\" (in bold) below. In your submission, all code must be written from scratch by you. While you can use the base modules of python (os, string etc) and NumPy, you cannot use sklearn or any equivalent ML library (when in doubt, ask about imports). It is recommended to use the reference pipeline while implementing your own functions. This way, you can try your own code throughout, without having to get all the moving parts in place before testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Submission\n",
        "\n",
        "Please submit your code as a notebook through studium. You should include the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A working implementation of your pipeline, reproducing your principal results when run. Please rerun your notebook as the last thing you do before submitting.\n",
        "2. Comment the code properly, especially for longer or opaque functionality. Please try to write self documenting code (i.e., choosing descriptive variables names, refactoring to isolate functionality, minimal code duplication etc).\n",
        "3. A *brief* description (100-200 words in total) of the implementation work that was necessary to complete the different parts, showing how you arrived at your solution and design choices made. You can spread these in the notebook or put them in one place.\n",
        "4. Comments on what you thought was hard in the assignment, what you think was educational, what took most time and which parts might be unnecessarily tricky.\n",
        "5. As submissions are anonymous, **all personal information must be removed**. This is a hard requirement.\n",
        "6. Apart from section titles, please remove all unnecessary text and code from the notebook you hand in. Keep only that which strengthens the case that you fulfil the listed requirements. All notebooks containing unnecessary chunks of text from this instruction will receive a failing grade (U).\n",

        "2. When evaluating your model, split the data into a training and a test set. This split can be selected non-randomly before running any training. The split should be 80/20 (i.e., 1600 training documents and 400 test documents). *It is easier for you if the classes are balanced.*\n",
        "3. Your code should work as plug-in replacements for the vectorizer and model. Hence, you should implement the model and the vectorizer as classes following the sklearn API as:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "class feature_transform:\n",

        "    ...\n",
        "```\n",
        "4. Include a short (150 words) analysis in your submission. Discuss the final decision boundary (i.e., why did some word contribute to a negative/positive label), the selected hyperparameters, and design choices. Note that hyperparameters do not need to be systematically selected, use something that works.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Additional requirements for grade VG\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve a pass with distinction (VG) in this assignment, you must adequately solve the tasks above for a passing grade (G). In addition, you must:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Implement the optimization as *stochastic* gradient descent (SGD)\n",
        "2. Implement a [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) feature model, and compare classification performance to bag-of-words (this should also be briefly discussed in your analysis). Choose your preferred formulation of tf-idf from the literature, *briefly* motivating your choice.\n",
        "3. Implement an extension to the SDG optimization of your choice, e.g. from [this list on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Extensions_and_variants).\n",
        "4. Implement [k-fold cross validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#k-fold_cross-validation) for evaluating and comparing your model variants.\n",
        "5. Prepare a presentation (~5min) with analysis of your design choices, pipelines, and results. How much did you gain in performance by using the more complex pipelines? The analysis and claims must be essentially correct. Submit and handful of slides in pdf format with your notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "## General advice\n",
        "\n",
        "The task is to predict, for an unseen review, whether it is positive or negative. This is a binary classification task. Work from the given code and change one piece at a time. You should test your code every couple of lines to make sure your assumptions on functionality and variable content are correct. A good rule of thumb is that a coder will introduce a bug every five lines (even as a professional).\n",
        "\n",
        "To make sure your code does what it is supposed to do, use ```assert``` statements to check your assumptions. Keep the given asserts if you need them. Professional coders sometimes start with writing tests for some functionality instead of starting with the functionality itself. This is called *test-driven development*.\n",
        "\n",
        "When developing, it is often best to start with *simple and clear code*, then going on to think about efficiency. Writing efficient code will not help you if you've missunderstood parts of the task description. For example, when finding the gradient, start by creating the vector and running a `for` loop over the data. Only then do you go on to experiemnt with vector operations and sparse matrices (assuming you want to).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Plagiarism\n",
        "\n",
        "In code assignments, plagiarism is a tricky concept. A clean cut way would be to demand that you write all the code yourself, from memory, with only the assigned literature as help. This is not how code is developed professionally, where it is common to copy and share. However, since this is a learning exercise, you must implement everything on your own, but please look at the course repo, Stack Overflow etc. Moreover, discuss with course mates and TAs to find inspiration and solutions. Code that is *obviously* copied (with minor modifications) will be considered as plagiarized. As a rule of thumb, if you can explain a solution to some problem in a brief discussion, you're safe. If you share your code, even with the best of intentions (or due to social pressure), the submitted (or committed) code with the earliest time stamp will be considered as the original. As a part of the examination, you might be asked to explain any particular part of the functionality in your implementation."

Note that $x_0$ in this notation is the pseudo input 1. When evaluated, this gives us the predicted results as $\\hat y_i = f(X_i, \\omega^{(t)})$, where $\\omega^{(t)}$ is the parameter vector at optimization iteration t and $\\omega^{(0)}$ is the initial guess for the parameter vector.\n",

The regularization always has some positive attenuation parameter $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ keeping it from dominating the objective function. It symbolizes a trade-off between a more accurate classification and wider margins, while also giving the objective function a unique solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Gradient descent**. The update for gradient descent looks like $\\omega^{(t)} = \\omega^{(t-1)} - \\gamma \\nabla \\mathfrak{L}(\\omega^{(t-1)})$, where the update gradient is defined as $\\nabla \\mathfrak{L}(X, y, \\omega) = \\left ( \\frac{\\partial \\mathfrak{L}(X, y, \\omega)}{\\partial \\omega_0}, \\frac{\\partial \\mathfrak{L}(X, y, \\omega)}{\\partial \\omega_1}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\partial \\mathfrak{L}(X, y, \\omega)}{\\partial \\omega_n} \\right )^\\top$.

        "\n",
        "For optimization of the hyperparameters, you can search for values on a grid. Trying all combinations is called a grid search and can be implemented with nested `for` loops. A faster alternative is to sample from the grid. Sampling is not as thorough, but most often sufficient (and much faster). Following the current consensus on ML methodology, we must split off a test set before exploring any configuration and use this data only at the very end of the experiment. You can use sklearn for the hyperparameter search.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implementation task:** Implement code for printing a sorted table of your sampled hyperparameters. Note, you do not have to reimplement the grid search.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Learning rate**. Try different settings of the learning rate. It is useful to pick values from an exponentially spaced grid (e.g., 0.0001/0.0003/0.001/0.003/0.01/0.03/0.1/0.3/1.0/3.0) where each of the values is about 3 times as large as the previous one. Note what happens when the learning rate gets too small or too large. The best learning rate is as large as possible, but still reliable and stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Regulariser dampening**. Try to find how much the regulariser needs to be dampened to get a good score. Use an exponentially spaced grid here as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The grid points can be generated as `np.exp(np.linspace(np.log(0.0001), np.log(3), 10))`, and pick a random subset by running `np.random.choice(your_array, size=10)` (the code below generates 100 grid points but only tries 10 of them). For these real valued hyperparameters, you can add extra points if you find a promising interval. Note that trying every combination of hyperparameters is likely not feasible, but don't hesitate to try.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you’ve settled on a final set of hyperparameters that work well/decently (and only then!), use the test set and rerun to obtain an accuracy score on the test set."
